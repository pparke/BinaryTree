Development Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following `npm` scripts are available to you, performing the tasks as
described below.

```sh
npm start     # Launch a development server. Same as `gulp dev`.
npm run dist  # Prepare the game release for distribution. Also `gulp dist`.
npm run clean # Delete temporary and distribution build files.
```

There are also sub-generators that may be used as follows:

```sh
yo phaser-plus:<sub-generator>
```

The following sub-generators are available, performing the tasks as described:

*   `state` : Generates `Phaser.State` classes.
*   `object`: Helps creating game objects from a set of base classes.
*   `plugin`: A boilerplate for your own Phaser plug-ins.

(Also, you may want to install Gulp globally, but you are not required to do
so.)

Should you consider distributing your game as an open source project, please
[include a LICENSE file][lcnc] in your project root.

Congrats and happy coding!
